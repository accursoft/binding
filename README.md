GUI Data Binding for Haskell
============================

The core binding framework is in binding-core, enabling data binding between mutable data or lists and IO objects. Usage is demonstrated by HUnit and QuickCheck tests.

GUI wrappers for Gtk2Hs and WxHaskell are provided in binding-gtk and binding-wx respectively. These include demo programs for both simple data binding and binding lists.
